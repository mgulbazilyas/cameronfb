Self-promoting posts are not accepted in this group due to the large amount of available crew looking for work. Any such posts will be deleted without notice***...We are a group for yachties based or visiting in Palma and the Balearic islands, where you can meet up with anyone interested in activities ranging from dock parties, nights out on town, hiking in the mountains, lunch at the Lamb Shack, hanging on the beach, going for a dive, looking for a gym partner, a game of football or rugby, dinner in a cool new restaurant, a movie - you name it ! Palma Yacht Crew is also a group for people, who are new in town, looking for advice or for anyone looking to network. Ask questions, but try using the search function first. That way you can find heaps of replies from previous posts regarding the same subject. Palma Yacht Crew is part of a worldwide crew support network. Feel free to join our other groups;Antibes Yacht CrewBarcelona Yacht CrewItaly Yacht CrewMalta Yacht Crew Scandinavia & Baltic Yacht CrewFort Lauderdale Yacht CrewCuba Yacht CrewSt Maarten Yacht CrewAntigua Yacht CrewVirgin Islands Yacht Crew Australia Yacht CrewSE Asia Yacht CrewDubai Yacht CrewYacht Crew Jobs Yacht Crew CVand the two for the slightly crazy or shutterbugs; Yacht Freaks and Yacht Crew Photos.If you have plans for the night or the weekend, and you don't mind others joining in, post them on the board and have fun with a few other likeminded group members.BAD LANGUAGE AND COMMENTS WHICH ARE INSULTING WILL BE REMOVED AND USER BLOCKED. NO NAMING AND SHAMING !!People are being sued for accommodating naming and shaming posts. Other people are being named and  shamed for reasons that are completely unfair or even by revenge. Naming and shaming only invites trouble. It is agreed that it would helpful information, but only as long as it is true, and the accused side has an option to respond with their side of the story. A good way to  avoid abusive captains and owners is to use well-established crew agencies or your own personal network. There are heaps of \"cowboys\" here on Facebook, employers as well as crew. When using Facebook, you are on your own... ADVERTISERS;   - Contact Molin Lars at Palmayachtcrew@gmail.com , if you have questions about advertising. A 10% discount or a special deal for group members must be included. You post will be removed by the admin team, if you forget to include any such offer - sorry. Advertising Day for everyone is on the 1st of each month, only - please respect this. Adverts that don't comply will be removed.- No Real Estate Agent and Financial Services adverts. - No real estate for sale adverts- Cars for sale posts must be pre-approved by admin- PC and MAC repairs only accepted by registered repair centers. - Adverts must be related to yacht crew. - Adverts on all other dates than the 1st of the month will be deleted without notice. All GROUPS RULES can be found in the \"Group Description\"WARNINGS;Palma is a great and quite safe place. As anywhere else there are dodgy characters, however. \"The street boys\" and their related mates hanging out on Plaza Drassana in La Lonja are bad news. Numerous people have been mugged in the streets leading up towards the art museum. Don't flash your latest iPhones and fat wallets. If after dark you need to head to Santa Catalina (Havana Bar, Bar Cuba etc) from the Corner Bar walk along Paseo Maritimo. Basically, when heading out on town, bring only the cash you need along with a copy of your passport. Leave your credit cards etc at home. TRY TO WALK IN COMPANY OF OTHERS OR STAY IN WELL LIT AND BUSY AREAS AT NIGHT. Show common sense - even when you had a few drinks (if that's possible..).SPIKED DRINKS have been experienced by several yacht crew over the past few years. It happens to girls as well as guys, so remember to WATCH YOUR DRINKS or have a mate look after it for you, if you have to leave it. It has happened in La Lonja, Santa Catalina and on the Paseo Maritimo. In short it could happen anywhere, so be vigilant !!BICYCLES are also popular among thieves - remember to lock them up, even tripple lock them ! There is not much you can do about it other than cutting your losses to the cheapest pedals on the block, or carrying your bike with you inside. CYCLING in Palma;Beware the following fines are possible;GOT NO LIGHTS: 90\u20acWEARING HEADPHONES:200\u20acGOT NO BELL: 200\u20acRIDE ON SIDEWALK: 60\u20ac\/300\u20acPICKPOCKETS: Again, watch your wallet and phone !! Santa Catalina market has seen a few pickpockets, but basically anywhere with large crowds and foreigners including old town. They are pretty good at it too.. Watch out for the ladies handing you flowers. Next they expect a 1 \u20ac tip and somehow in the process manage to run away with everything of vaue in your wallet. If they manage to touch you, instantly check your pockets etc.Pickpockets act in groups, with look outs etc. They also have so-called prompters. It works this way; An individual will bump into you walking by and intentionaly look like, he may have picked your pocket. Another is watching you both, to see your reaction. You will automaticaly take your hand to your wallet to check you still have it. They now know exactly, where you have it. The one, who saw you do this, is the one who will follow you for a bit to get into your walking gait. He\/she will then make a move to pick pocket you. So summing up, if someone bumps into you or touches you, or you feel like you may be getting unwanted attention, never check your pockets straight out. Keep an eye all around you and your pocket area and go into a shop or safe place away from the windows before you check. This tactic works very well on buses too; the 21 and 3 lines of the EMT are rumored to be rife with pick pockets. One bumps into you, then once you have checked your wallet, another will then nick it without you noticing. Keep the change for a bus in a separate pocket, as they watch, when you get on to see where you return the wallet to.TELEPHONES; try not to flash your telephones in the bars (leaving them at the counter in particular), as these are nicked day in day out from drinking establishments throughout the city.SHORTCHANGING; an old trick of the trade, which probably goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden. It is not uncommon in bars and restaurants, even in some shops, when a euro or two is missing from your change. Count it! BAG SNATCHING in the area of Havana, Bar Cuba, Soho and down on Paseo Maritimo happens from time to time. Leave your valuables at home. Only bring enough cash to last through the evening. No need to bring your credit card, when out on town.  DON'T text\/play with your phone while walking either. It draws attention to you ! Try to avoid walking alone - PLEASE.LUXURY WATCHES are being targeted by thieves in the Portals Nous - Puerto Andratx area. LOOKING FOR CREW: Yachts looking for crew can post anytime.
